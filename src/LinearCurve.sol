/**
 * @title  LinearCurve
 * @author 0xIntuition
 * @notice ðŸŽ¯ The OG, battle-tested share price model, now reborn as a bonding curve! 
 *         This magnificent specimen takes the legacy share price logic - a time-honored 1:1 
 *         relationship between assets and shares - and wraps it in our shiny new bonding curve 
 *         architecture. While it's currently chillin' on the sidelines of our ETHMultiVault 
 *         implementation (we see you, future integrations ðŸ‘€), this curve is the unsung hero 
 *         of low-risk incentivization.
 *
 *         Here's the secret sauce: instead of fancy mathematical gymnastics, this curve relies 
 *         on the pure, unadulterated power of fees to affect share price. When fees roll in, 
 *         they're distributed proportionally across all shareholders, creating a gentle upward 
 *         pressure on share value. It's like watching paint dry, but the paint is made of MONEY! ðŸ’°
 *
 *         This creates an incredibly based, low-risk incentivization model where early stakers 
 *         benefit from the natural accumulation of fees over time. No wild price swings, no 
 *         complex formulas - just steady, reliable value accrual. It's the Toyota Corolla of 
 *         bonding curves: not flashy, but it'll get you there every single time! ðŸš—
