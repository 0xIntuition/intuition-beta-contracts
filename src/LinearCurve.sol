 * @title  LinearCurve
 * @author 0xIntuition
 * @notice ðŸŽ¯ The OG, battle-tested share price model, now reborn as a bonding curve!
 *         This magnificent specimen takes the legacy share price logic - a time-honored 1:1
 *         relationship between assets and shares - and wraps it in our shiny new bonding curve
 *         architecture. While it's currently chillin' on the sidelines of our ETHMultiVault
 *         implementation (we see you, future integrations ðŸ‘€), this curve is the unsung hero
 *         of low-risk incentivization.
 *
 * @notice Here's the secret sauce: instead of fancy mathematical gymnastics, this curve relies
 *         on the pure, unadulterated power of fees to affect share price. When fees roll in,
 *         they're distributed proportionally across all shareholders, creating a gentle upward
 *         pressure on share value. It's like watching paint dry, but the paint is made of MONEY! ðŸ’°
 *
 * @notice This creates an incredibly based, low-risk incentivization model where early stakers
 *         benefit from the natural accumulation of fees over time. No wild price swings, no
 *         complex formulas - just steady, reliable value accrual. It's the Toyota Corolla of
 *         bonding curves: not flashy, but it'll get you there every single time! ðŸš—
 *
 * @dev This curve is not actually used in this version of the EthMultiVault, so as to avoid changing
 *      audited code.  It is left here to demonstrate the design pattern of curves for V2.  This curve
 *      replaces the legacy "pro-rata" logic by wrapping it in the Bonding Curve architecture.
